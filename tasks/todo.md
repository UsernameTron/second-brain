# Todo

## Current
- [x] Execute Phase 2: Content Pipeline (461 tests passing, cross-AI reviewed PASS)

## Followup
- [ ] **DEFECT (LOW): in-batch dedup gap in src/promote-memories.js:330-338** — two proposals with identical contentHash in the same promotion batch can both promote. Fix: track Set of promoted hashes inside batch loop + add test. Surfaced by Gemini + host-session review of Phase 2.
- [ ] UAT pending: LLM classification accuracy spot-check on real captures
- [ ] UAT pending: wikilink relevance review against memory.md output
- [ ] UAT pending: Obsidian UX walkthrough for capture → promote flow
- [ ] **DEFECT: Config hot-reload not firing — fs.watch broken or cache not invalidating.** Workaround: restart Node process after config edits. Debug in dedicated session.
- [ ] **Expand excluded-terms.json to 15-20 entries before v1 go-live** — Categories: former employer product names, project codenames, client names, internal tools, senior leadership names. Currently 3 seed entries (ISPN, Genesys, Asana).
